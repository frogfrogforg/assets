# Summary

After not being able to find a Nintendo DSi stylus file anywhere on the internet that fits well and is actually usable, I decided to make my own.

I added the little nub which locks the stylus into the DSi, since that's one of the main reasons that people manage to loose the stylus in the first place.

The stylus will need some quick sanding down with fine sandpaper on the end to get rid of any sharp bits that could possibly scratch the DSi screen. I did this as a precaution since I didn't want to scratch my screen but it is clean and usable straight off the print bed.

Please leave a like on the model if it worked for you, since this is my first public thing, any feedback would be greatly appreciated!
